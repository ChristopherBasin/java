Hello, I am Christopher John R. Basin and together with Maria Rica Dean M. Banaag, we created a Car Security
System application where the user (The security guard of the subdivision), can scan if the approaching
vehicle is registered or is a resident of Victor's Subdivision. It uses database(MySQL) to store, or get
information of the car plates. It is a simple design that can help the user tract cars going inside the 
subdivision and enhance security measures.

How to run: 
at the cmd of VS code, use this command:
java -cp ".;lib/mysql-connector-j-9.3.0.jar" MainWindow
